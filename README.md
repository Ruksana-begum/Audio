# Audio Steganography

This Python application allows users to perform audio steganography, 
a technique for hiding secret messages within audio files. 
The program utilizes the Ceasar cipher for encryption and decryption of messages.

## Encryption

It is the process of translating plain text data into something that appears to be random and meaningless,
provides high security and privacy on sharing any confidential data on any social media. 

## Features

- **Encode Audio**: Embed a secret message into an audio file.
- **Decode Audio**: Extract the hidden message from an encoded audio file.
- **Play Encoded Audio**: Listen to the encoded audio along with the decoded message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- wave (Python module)

  ## useful

  Audio stenography is useful for secure communication, covert information exchange, and copyright protection in contexts such as intelligence agencies, journalism, digital forensics, and personal privacy.
